# Flexbox Gallery

This is a project from Module 6 (Build a Responsive Site) of Scrimba's [Frontend Developer Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). It focuses on CSS Flexbox properties of `flex-wrap`, `gap`, `flex`, `flex-basis`, `flex-grow` and the CSS property `object-fit` in CSS. Note how the panels are different widths, creating a staggered, brick-like effect.
